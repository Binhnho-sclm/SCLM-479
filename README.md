# From Market Challenges to Competitive Advantage: A Strategic Framework for Fine Scandinavia’s Distribution and Retail of Nordic Kitchenware in Vietnam
**Description**
The capstone project under course SCLM 479 – Integrated Supply and Logistics Management to link and connect the supply chain intelligence of the students after learning the supply chain management core modules. In the coming year, Fine Scandinavia plans to introduce a new line of premium Nordic kitchenware and small home appliances into the Vietnamese market under an exclusive distributorship with leading Scandinavian brands. While the Vietnamese middle-class is growing and becoming more design-conscious, the market remains price-sensitive and competitive with strong local and Asian alternatives.
The company faces several strategic and operational challenges: balancing import costs, forecasting market demand, managing inventory for high-value, bulky products, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining product differentiation in marketing and retail strategy. These issues must be addressed to ensure profitable growth, brand positioning, and customer satisfaction.
**Objectives:**
-	To integrate and apply knowledge from core supply chain modules—including operations, purchasing, production, human resources, and strategic management—into a real-world business scenario.
-	To identify current trends, challenges, or gaps in the supply chain and develop innovative, entrepreneurial solutions tailored to a partner company or business context.
-	To conduct a comprehensive feasibility study and develop a strategic business plan that includes market analysis, competitive positioning, operations planning, and forecasting.
-	To develop, present, and defend a sales pitch or strategic business initiative to stakeholders, demonstrating persuasive communication, critical thinking, and data-informed decision-making.
-	To assess and propose strategies for business resilience and sustainability in areas such as operations efficiency, environmental practices, and community engagement.
-	To apply tools for performance measurement and control, evaluating the success of proposed strategies and identifying areas for continuous improvement.
-	To foster effective teamwork, leadership, project management, and conflict resolution skills in the context of hospitality project development.
